# tank-game
The project is about a game developed using Greenfoot in java. This game revolves around two player battle tanks fighting against enemy tanks in order to win the game. The tanks have movement controls, rotation controls and shoot functionality. Using these features, the tanks move in any desired direction in search of enemy tanks to find and kill them. Players' score depends on the respective number of enemy tanks damaged or killed. The game ends when either all enemy tanks are destroyed or if both the players' lives are exhausted. The players' high score is then recorded for comparison with subsequent rounds' score.
